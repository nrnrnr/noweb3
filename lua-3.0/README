* What is Lua?
  Lua is a simple, yet powerful, language for extending applications.
  Lua has been developed by TeCGraf, the Computer Graphics Technology Group
  of PUC-Rio, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
  Dozens of industrial products developed by TeCGraf use Lua.

* Some features of Lua
  + simple syntax (Pascal-like);
  + powerful data description constructs (e.g., associative arrays);
  + user-controlled type constructors;
  + extensible semantics with tag methods;
  + garbage collection;
  + Lua programs are compiled into bytecodes, which are then interpreted;
  + truly portable, written in ANSI C.
