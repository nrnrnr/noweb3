These are build and installation notes for *alpha* versions of Noweb 3.

Start by following the instruction in README to build and install Noweb 3.

If the build or install isn't working, try the following:

  1) Set PLATFORM to show how to run pipelines.  Leave this alone for now.

  2) The Lua kludges are (hopefully) temporary.  These are an acknowledgement
     that Noweb 3 is still alpha.  If we ever get Noweb 3 to Lua 5, these
     should be fixed. Leave these alone for now.

  3) There is a very hacky nocond executable that is built from the tools
     directory for systems that don't have sed available.  There is also a
     nocond script that uses sed which you can set NOCOND to instead.

  4) Now, set configuration for your system:
     First point a compiler to be used to build the tools and
     library by setting the CC variable in the Makefile:
       CC         the name of an ANSI C compiler
       CFLAGS     general flags used througout the build
       XCFLAGS    flags used in addition to CFLAGS when building no
       O          the extension of object files produced by your compiler
       LD         what to call to build an executable binary
       LDFLAGS    general flags used to build an executable
       LIBPROLOG  anything you need to place before listing libraries
       LIBEPILOG  anything you need to place after listing libraries
       E          the extension of executable files produced by your linker
       AR         what to call to build an object-code library
       A          the extension of library files produced by your archiver
       RMDIR      How to recursively and quietly remove directories
       RM         How to quietly remove a set of files
       CP         How to copy a file
       CPR        How to recursively copy all files in a directory
       RANLIB     how to index an object-code library

     If your system provides tempnam(3), noweb's indexing will be more
     efficient if you add -DTEMPNAM to XCFLAGS given to the C compiler.

  5) Noweb 3 is built using parts of Dave Hanson's CII and PUC-Rio's Lua.
     There's an ugly wart on the installation of CII; you *must* set
     the CIIMAXALIGN variable as explained in cii/install.html, or you
     risk random memory errors, core dumps, or assertion failures.

     The rest of the nwconfig helps protect against a few oddities.

Instead of editing the nwconfig, you can create a shell script that
invokes make with the proper variables.  `limake' is an example of
such a script.  If you make your own script, call it something else so
it won't get overwritten by the default nwmake when you unbundle a new
distribution.

If you encounter a problem building noweb 3, please send email to
