* Installation
  Installing Lua should be very easy:

	1. Edit "config" to suit your platform, if at all necessary
	2. Then, type "make"

* What you get
  If make succeeds, you get:
	* a compiler and an interpreter in ./bin/lua;
	* libraries in ./lib;
	* include files in ./include.

  There is a reference manual in ./doc, and tests and examples in ./test.
  You don't need these directories for development.

* If you have problems (and solutions!)
  If make fails, please let us know (lua@icad.puc-rio.br).
  If you make changes to "config", please send them to us.

* Shared libraries
  If you are running SunOs 4.x, type the following after "make" succeeds:
	ld -o lib/liblua.so.2.5 src/*.o
	ld -o lib/liblualib.so.2.5 clients/lib/*.o

  For AIX, the OpenGL clone Mesa includes a script for making shared libraries.
  For other systems, please let us know how!
