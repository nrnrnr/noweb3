NAME
     luac - Lua compiler

SYNOPSIS
     luac [ -dlpv ] [ -o outputfile ] sourcefile ...

DESCRIPTION
     luac is the Lua compiler.  It translates programs written in
     the Lua programming language into binary files that can be
     loaded and executed with lua_dofile in C or dofile in Lua.

     luac produces a single output file containing the bytecode
     for all named source files.  By default, the output file is
     named luac.out, but you can change this with the -o option.

     You can use "-" to indicate stdin as a source file.

OPTIONS
     -d        turns debugging on.

     -l        produces a listing of the compiled bytecode for
               Lua's virtual machine.

     -p        parses sources files but does not generate any
               output file.

     -v        prints version information.

     -o outputfile
               Name the output file output, instead of the
               default luac.out.  The output file cannot be a
               source file.

FILES
     luac.out            default output file
