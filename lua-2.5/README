* What is Lua?
  Lua is a simple, yet powerful, language for extending applications.
  Lua has been developed by TeCGraf, the Computer Graphics Technology Group
  of PUC-Rio, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
  Dozens of industrial products developed by TeCGraf use Lua.

* Some features of Lua
  + a simple, pascal-like, syntax
  + powerful data description constructs (e.g., associative arrays)
  + user-controlled type constructors
  + fallbacks for extending the language in unconventional ways (e.g.,
    inheritance, overloading)
  + garbage collection
  + Lua programs are compiled into bytecodes, which are then interpreted
  + portable, written in ANSI C (runs in Unix, DOS, Windows, Mac, Cray, ...)
